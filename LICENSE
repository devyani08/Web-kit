Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to contribute to a commons of creative, cultural, and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can build upon, modify, and
reuse only for non-commercial purposes and with explicit permission from the owner.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, the person
associating this modified CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply this modified CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of this modified CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under this license may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). These include, but are not limited to:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
communicate, and translate a Work only for non-commercial purposes;
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
likeness depicted in a Work;
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use, and reuse of data
in a Work;
vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
protection of databases, and under any national implementation
thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
directive); and
vii. other similar, equivalent, or corresponding rights throughout the
world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
implementations thereof.

2. Non-Commercial Use Restriction.

The Work may not be used for commercial purposes. "Commercial purposes" include but are not limited to:

Selling, licensing, or distributing copies of the Work for financial gain.

Using the Work in advertising or marketing materials.

Incorporating the Work into products, services, or applications that generate revenue.

3. Permission Requirement.

Access to the Work is restricted, and it cannot be used, copied, modified, or distributed without explicit written permission from the owner.

Individuals or organizations wishing to use the Work must contact the owner and obtain written consent before proceeding.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
surrendered, licensed, or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
statutory, or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-
infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
this license or use of the Work.

5. Enforcement.

This modified CC0 1.0 Universal license ensures that the Work is protected from unauthorized commercial exploitation and requires explicit permission for access and use.
